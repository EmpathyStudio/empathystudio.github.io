      <description>Slow Glow kinetic light
An interior solar eclipse. Observe the sun &amp;amp; moon dynamically change before you. Allow yourself to align with the movement of the moon and feel calm, reflective &amp;amp; present. You know what is going to happen next but you can&amp;rsquo;t take your eyes away. Captivated by the eclipsing of light. The anticipation is intriguing.
Both serving as an interior piece for cosy evenings and a larger scale public art installation.</description>

      <description>The voice &amp; responsive lighting
A realtime response to the human voice. Become captivated in a warm glow to the sound of sultry tones. The combination of choral music and light. Two of the purest elements in our lives together playing in harmony.
With scope that extends beyond music performance into the realms of therapy and mindful spaces, this piece has unlimited potential for reflection, contemplation &amp;amp; healing.
A custom PCB was created to live within the light diffuser.</description>

      <description>As the wood dies and rots away, the light will never fade. The woven structure resembles a cloud-like form made from wood. Contrast of the flow of branches against the industrial strip light. Eventually the surrounding branches will fall and the man-made light will remain. All the answers lie within nature, not technology.
&#34; There&#39;s some unease in the shape of the light source and the position of it It&#39;s below the branches, protected.</description>
