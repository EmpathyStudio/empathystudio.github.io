I want to sit underneath the branches.\nThe liner nature of the light and the way the branches appear suspended above gives a sense of power to the light. It's demonstrating a stronger force than the branches yet you know they are heavy and unforgiving to human skin. This power distribution is impactful and calming due to the form's simplicity. It feels knowing of itself. While I want to sit within it, I don't want to disturb it. I want to see it evolve; to observe a change in light strength, maybe also from a change in viewing position. The artificiality of the lightsource coming from a line rather than a circle lends to it's sense of distortion. With long exposure, you get extended light lines, this feels like one of them.

Whenever I need a reminder that anything is possible I dip in to this wonderful series. I was especially inspired by the episode on Bio-architecture. Researchers at MIT Media Lab led by Neri Oxman created domes from silk fibres created by live silkworms. Traditionally during the silk gathering process, the silkworm is sacrificed to harvest it's silk. However this method allows the silkworms to weave themselves. An army of natural constructors. Working with nature to create architecture. This got me thinking about light diffusion. I've been searching for new ways to diffuse light aside from Opal Acrylic or any other plastic based material. Paper works well and recycled paper offers interesting organic diffusion patterns. However it's not very robust. Imagine lamp shades woven by silkworms. Something to experiment with for sure. Nature is incredibly sophisticated - take funghi for example and their mycelial networks. We have so much to learn and I'm confident that the answer to our environmental problems lie within the environment itself.

I became aware of the incredible natural phenomena during research into kinetic lighting displays for music performance. Bioluminescence is essentially light emitted by living things through chemical reactions in their bodies. The chemical reaction requires two unique chemicals: luciferin and either luciferase or photoprotein. This reaction can be triggered by motion. And therefore triggered by vibrations. And therefore triggered by sound waves! I have created numerous audio reactive pieces that use microphones to change visuals to sound. I'm increbibly fascinated by the thought of audio reactive visuals using bioluminescence. A Living performance. A light has been created by Dutch designer Teresa van Dongen by using octopus bacteria in a glass tube that glows blue when disturbed. Though the light only lasts two days until nutrients for the bacteria are depleted or multiply too much for the tube to contain. Tersesa van Dongen Ambio bioluminescent light\nI'd like to build on this and experiment further. A concept that requires keeping a species alive to maintain a light source.
